# Cash or Card Model

This repository contains code for a structural model of payment choice, queueing, and enforcement under heterogeneous payment technologies.

The model studies how acceptance of electronic payments affects demand, congestion, reporting behavior, and enforcement outcomes, with particular attention to endogenous audit signals derived from transaction data.
